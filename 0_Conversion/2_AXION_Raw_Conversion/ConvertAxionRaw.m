% Overall aim of this script is to split raw data from multi-well plate
% into a separate .mat file for each MEA in the plate.  It can currently
% accommodate 6- up to 48-well plates.  

% Step 1 - Load the folder where your .raw data files are from plate to individual MEAs.  This is the first step to using the data with our 
% analysis pipeline developed for MCS data. Please include appropriate
% slash (/ or \) at the end of path. 
%dirname =  'C:\Users\aboschi\OneDrive - Fondazione Istituto Italiano Tecnologia\Desktop\SAND Boston\Data\RAW\';

% Step 2 - Loop through all of the files.  This first part extracts the names of the
% raw data files, arrangement of the wells and creates a .csv file with the
% file names for use downstream in the network analysis pipeline.
%filenames = dir(dirname);


% The line below creates the .csv file for the network analysis pipeline.
% You can name this file whatever is relevant for your experiment.
%metadatafilename = '20230502';

%Please answer the following questions to determine which information the
%output file (metadatafilename) will be automatically filled with

% fill_div='y'; %Did user write age groups in the following format (DIV4, DIV7, DIV10, etc.)? ('y' for yes, 'n' for no)
% fill_genotype='n'; %Did user only use one genotype group when recording? ('y' for yes, 'n' for no) 
% genotype='WT'; %If user answered no for fill_genotype, leave as empty string (''). Otherwise, enter your genotype group as a string.
